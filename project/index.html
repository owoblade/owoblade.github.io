<p>
  The current Crusalis Wiki is in a state of simply lacking information, showing misinformation and being heavily griefed.
  A public Wiki being in this state is borderline unacceptable and through the research done to help create crusalis related media 
  i find that a large ammount of crusalis related research is simply sitting on my drive. With the Crusalis Owners not taking the
  Wiki seriously I pledge that I will work as hard as possible to make this as useful of a rescource of possible.

<h3>
  But whats different to the crusalis wiki? Won't it just get griefed again?
</h3>
<p>
    In order to prevent vandalism, several measures have been taken in place. Access to the repo has been made invite only and in
    order to contribute any user will be put through heavy background checks. Anything added is manually reviewed and nothing is
    automated in such a way that means the wiki can simply be comprimised again.
</p>
<p>
    The website is intentionally designed to be simple html, and hosted simply through a github repo meaning its easy to fork so that
    even if the current management was to discontinue the project, it can still live on through community efforts.
    Simplicity is important!
