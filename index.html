  The Server chooses to run iterations which take place roughly every 2-3 months and last between 4-8 weeks in length. Throughout Crusalis History There Have Been the Following Iterations:
</p>
<p>
  The Server takes heavy inspiration from /int craft, a server the founders frequently spent time on which started originally in 2015.
  Crusalis was started as a passion project by the founders and has since been able to grow into one of Minecraft's largest
  geopolitical minecraft servers, a truly unique experience.
</p>
<p>
  The Server uses custom weapon and vehicle plugins each iteration to create accurate and fun to use vehicles such as Tanks, Planes, 
  Trains, and even artillery. The map is split into territory that players can fight over and see in real time using the <a href="https://map.crusalis.net/">Crusalis Dynmap</a>
</p>
<p>
  The server runs off a weekly schedule when active with weekly war periods every Satuarday at 1PM EST which last 3 hours although
  are sometimes extended. On a weekly basis, although usually Thursdays, towns are able to be rated by in what is commonly refered
  to as a 'nodesweep' where the builds are reviewed so that the 'node' that the town is located in can be given a teir. Higher teirs
  mean more and better rescources such as by unlocking factories and increasing the yield from T income
